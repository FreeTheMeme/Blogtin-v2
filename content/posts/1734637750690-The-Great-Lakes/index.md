As someone who lives in Michigan. I really love the Great Lakes. It's one of my favorite parts about my state. I recently went up north. I had the opportunity to stay at someone's house who was right on the coast of Lake Michigan. And we had this really cool fire. It was pretty great. I just love looking at the lakes. No matter if it's cloudy or if it's sunny, it's always got a different look that is just equally as beautiful as the other. Also the sands of Lake Michigan is like the perfect material to make those drippy sand castles with. They look like Little stalactites. It's also incredible to see it at night. It's a completely different experience. Last night we watched the sunset go down and we made a little campfire on the shoreline. We made some hot dogs and after that we made some s'mores. the stars where Incredible. at night.

I know this blog is quite different from the past few blogs I've made. I know this is more about the real world than my Minecraft server, but I thought it'd be interesting to talk about it. I'll probably write down more of my life experiences in future posts. Because over my entire life I've journaled a few times and it's so easy to forget like those fine details years later. It would be nice to look back on it later.
