Sorry i haven't posted anything in a while but now i have things to talk about ðŸ¥³

### the thing I want blog about 
so last year my boyfriend (Ace) made a fursuit body right before MFF (Midwest Fur Fest). and it looked really good
I also made a fursuit but it was just the head i didn't feel like i did that great of a job hence I don't wear it like
at all. But today I'm going to start a new project making tails!

### more than one!
Since my fursona kitsune or a seven tail fox need to make seven of then. Witch is uncharted territory I have not found many tutorials online that could help me in my endeavor I've found few fursuiters with multiple tails and asked how do your a tails work? which is quite weird question to ask now that I'm typing this out but anyways in the next blog I will document my progress of making theses tails.
