Okay, so this is the second post on the blog. Honestly, nothing has really happened in the Minecraft server. With a dynamic trees mod It has been really hard to get wood. Iron, for some reason also, has been hard to come by. I really don't understand why. I feel like I've mined a sufficient amount. There just seems to be no iron in them hills.

Recently, I've been trying to make a tree farm. On an island near the base where I built castle walls. Ace built a bridge recently. I don't know why it just appeared. And he's the only other Person on the server. I should probably talk more about the wall that surrounds the base. It's made out of tuff bricks, which I've never really worked with tuff before. But it's really nice. The bridge that Ace built is also built out of that.

In this picture above, you can see the bridge that Ace built, and you can kind of see the wall that I'm standing on, which is the castle wall that goes around the base. I've never used tuff before. Must be like a new block. I don't know what version of Minecraft it came out in, but we're playing a modded 18.2 server, So it probably came out in the deep dark update when they added tuff.
