# MFF con log

MFF 2024 was a really good con. I went to more panels than I've ever had before.

Some notable panels were:

## The tail panel.

As someone who obsesses over tails, the tail panel is pretty great. I didn't know so many others appreciated tails as much as I did. It was great to have other people to talk about tails with. There was also this person who had a nine-tailed umbreon fursuit. Which is the inspiration For the tails I'm making for my fursuit. I also got the opportunity to wear the tails.ðŸ«¨

## The furry history preservation panel.

I was intrigued by this panel, because I like learning the history about things. Hearing stories from the past, I find it very interesting and informative. I also like data preservation So the panel was very relevant to me and my interests. 

## The transformation meet and greet

I went to this panel last year and it was really fun. But this year, I met the person who made the video that turned me into a furry. It was like a dragon transformation video. Honestly, I was amazed that I would ever meet the person who made that. I also met some other artists and had some really good conversations with a lot of people.

Usually for any given con I've only gone to like one panel. I mostly try to hang out with friends. Which obviously I also did a lot of. I also got fucking drunk Saturday night, which I don't usually do that much anymore, which is probably for the betterðŸ¤£. 

I also went to the rave. Probably one of the best. MFF raves seem to be the most incredible raves at any convention I've gone to.

Also, on the Sky Bridge, I saw a wine glass sitting on a window sill. I was like, there has to be some sort of story behind this. Why was it just left here?
