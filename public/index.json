But today I\u0026rsquo;m going to start a new project making tails! more than one! # Since my fursona kitsune or a seven tail fox need to make seven of then. Witch is uncharted territory I have not found many tutorials online that could help me in my endeavor I\u0026rsquo;ve found few fursuiters with multiple tails and asked how do your a tails work? which is quite weird question to ask now that I\u0026rsquo;m typing this out but anyways in the next blog I will document my progress of making theses tails.\n","date":"16 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1734639233933-project-tails/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003elong time no see \n    \u003cdiv id=\"long-time-no-see\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#long-time-no-see\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e","title":"Project TailsðŸ¦Š","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/outside/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Outside","type":"tags"},{"content":" As someone who lives in Michigan. I really love the Great Lakes. It\u0026rsquo;s one of my favorite parts about my state. I recently went up north. I had the opportunity to stay at someone\u0026rsquo;s house who was right on the coast of Lake Michigan. And we had this really cool fire. It was pretty great. I just love looking at the lakes. No matter if it\u0026rsquo;s cloudy or if it\u0026rsquo;s sunny, it\u0026rsquo;s always got a different look that is just equally as beautiful as the other. Also the sands of Lake Michigan is like the perfect material to make those drippy sand castles with. They look like Little stalactites. It\u0026rsquo;s also incredible to see it at night. It\u0026rsquo;s a completely different experience. Last night we watched the sunset go down and we made a little campfire on the shoreline. We made some hot dogs and after that we made some s\u0026rsquo;mores. the stars where Incredible. at night.\nI know this blog is quite different from the past few blogs I\u0026rsquo;ve made. I know this is more about the real world than my Minecraft server, but I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be interesting to talk about it. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write down more of my life experiences in future posts. Because over my entire life I\u0026rsquo;ve journaled a few times and it\u0026rsquo;s so easy to forget like those fine details years later. It would be nice to look back on it later.\n","date":"2 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1734637750690-the-great-lakes/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Great Lakes","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"26 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/minecraft/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Minecraft","type":"tags"},{"content":" Okay, so this is the second post on the blog. Honestly, nothing has really happened in the Minecraft server. With a dynamic trees mod It has been really hard to get wood. Iron, for some reason also, has been hard to come by. I really don\u0026rsquo;t understand why. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve mined a sufficient amount. There just seems to be no iron in them hills.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to make a tree farm. On an island near the base where I built castle walls. Ace built a bridge recently. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why it just appeared. And he\u0026rsquo;s the only other Person on the server. I should probably talk more about the wall that surrounds the base. It\u0026rsquo;s made out of tuff bricks, which I\u0026rsquo;ve never really worked with tuff before. But it\u0026rsquo;s really nice. The bridge that Ace built is also built out of that.\nIn this picture above, you can see the bridge that Ace built, and you can kind of see the wall that I\u0026rsquo;m standing on, which is the castle wall that goes around the base. I\u0026rsquo;ve never used tuff before. Must be like a new block. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what version of Minecraft it came out in, but we\u0026rsquo;re playing a modded 18.2 server, So it probably came out in the deep dark update when they added tuff.\n","date":"26 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1734640670000-tree_farm_new_bridge/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Tree farm new bridge","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/other/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Other","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":" This is a first post of hopefully many where I talk about the updates happening on my Minecraft server.
